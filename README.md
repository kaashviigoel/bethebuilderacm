# 🌤️ VibeCast

A vibe-based weather web app designed to make daily planning aesthetic, intuitive, and fun — especially for college students.

---

## 📌 Overview

VibeCast was built during the **Prompt to Production** event hosted by **ACM-VIT** and powered by **Vercel**.  

The project explores how AI-assisted development can accelerate turning an idea into a production-ready application.

---

## ❓ The Problem

Traditional weather applications often present data in a technical and clinical way. While accurate, they fail to answer questions students actually care about, such as:

- Is today good for hanging out on campus?
- Should I plan outdoor activities?
- Will weather affect my daily routine?

The emotional and lifestyle context — the *"vibe"* of the day — is usually missing.

---

## 💡 The Solution

VibeCast transforms raw weather data into relatable and lifestyle-focused insights using a modern, aesthetic interface.

It helps users plan their day by translating weather conditions into moods, activity recommendations, and simplified forecasts.
